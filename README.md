PalmExec works with the Palmsens BV Sensit Smart. The Sensit Smart unit performs many electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry. PalmExec sends instructions to the Sensit Smart unit and receives measurement data from the unit.  The data such as voltage and current are saved on the phone/tablet and can later be downloaded to and analyzed on a PC. 

PalmExec reads and executes MethodSCRIPTs. Methodscripts give complete control of the Sensit Smart. They are texts that are simple to edit prior to running PalmExec. Scripts permit the sequencing of many electrochemical methods. Once started scripts can run for minutes, hours or days. 

More on scripts in https://www.palmsens.com/app/uploads/2025/10/MethodSCRIPT-v1_8.pdf under the heading EMStat Pico. Sample scripts for linear sweep voltammetry with chronoamperometry, impedance spectroscopy, open circuit potentiometry and square wave voltammetry are included with PalmExec.

The app saves data in semicolon separated text files, either in the phone’s internal RAM or on an SD Card depending on how the phone/tablet is set up.

The simple java code for PalmExec is on GitHub https://github.com/DavidCecil50/PalmExec This code can be modified for measuring specific compounds in real time. A phone and Sensit Smart can become a standalone instrument. 

The original code for PalmExec was downloaded from GitHub at https://github.com/PalmSens/MethodSCRIPT_Examples Modifications in PalmExec include a file picker, data storage and extended handling of script codes.

PalmExec runs on phones starting with Android 8.0 

The app does not exchange data with the Internet.

I take no responsibility for any consequences of PalmExec's use.

PalmExec is not a Palmsens BV product.
